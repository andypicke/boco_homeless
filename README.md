# boco_homeless

## Project looking at patterns of homelessness-related arrests and possible relationships to weather in Boulder.

### Data was gathered by Sam: <https://github.com/samzhang111/boco-jail-analysis>

### I am doing some analysis of the data in R.
- The main code is in the R markdown file *wea_EDA_AndyP.Rmd*
- For viewing on Github, see the rendered markdown file *wea_EDA_AndyP.md*, which contains the code, output, and figures.
